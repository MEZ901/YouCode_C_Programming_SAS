## Challenge 1: Temperature Display

Write a program that asks for the temperature in Fahrenheit and transforms it into degrees Celsius and displays the feeling felt (very cold, cold, hot, very hot)

The formula: C = (F-32)/1.8

## Challenge 2: Even or Odd

Write a program that asks for a number and displays whether that number is even or odd

## Challenge 3: Permutation Under Conditions

Write a program in C to read two values. It swaps the two variables if the values ​​are not identical or if the first value is less than the second.

## Challenge 4:

Write a C program to calculate the sum of two given integer values. If the two values ​​are the same, it returns triple their sum.

## Challenge 5: Second degree equation

Write a C program that calculates the possible solutions of a 2nd degree equation.

## Challenge 6: Palindrome

A word is a palindrome if it is spelled the same if written backwards. "kayak" and "laval" are palindromes. Write a C program that determines whether a word, considered as an array of characters, is a palindrome or not. We will consider that the array, of at most 50 elements, is initialized in the C program

## Challenge 7:

We want to display the grade obtained by a ève en fonction de la moyenne de ses notes. S'il a une moyenne strictement inférieure than 10, he fails. If he has an average between 10 (inclusive) and 12, he gets a passing grade. If he has an average between 12 (inclusive) and 14, he gets a fair grade. If he has an average between 14 (inclusive) and 16, he obtains the mention bien. If he has an average higher à 16 (inclus) il obtient la mention tr well. Write the necessary instructions.

## Challenge 8:

Write a C program that reads a character and determines whether it is an alphabet or not. And if it is, say in addition if it is a lower case or a capital letter.

## Challenge 9:

Write a C program that reads a date in the format 10/15/2021 and displays it in the following format: 15-October-2021 .

## Challenge 10:

Write a C program that randomly displays one of the days of the week.

## Challenge 11:

The first moment comes before the second;
The second moment comes before the first;
It is the same moment.

## Challenge 12:

Write a C program that reads the coordinates of the two endpoints of a segment, and then reads the coordinates of a point in the plane and says whether the latter is on the segment or not.
