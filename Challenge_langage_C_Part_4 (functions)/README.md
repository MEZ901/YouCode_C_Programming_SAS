# work to do

## Challenge 1:

Create a function add(int a , int b) which adds the two numbers a and b.

## Challenge 2:

Create a swap() function to swap the value of a with the value of b, what do you see? also display the initial state of variables a and b.

## Challenge 3:

Create a bool isPrime() function to check if a number is prime or not (note that the type of the function is bool, so you need to create your Bool type).

## Challenge 4:

Create a function divededby(int n,int a) which returns the division of the two values. Use the dividedby() function to check if the number is prime and return true, otherwise it returns false.

## Challenge 5:

Write a C program to sort a list of items using the merge sort algorithm.

## Challenge 6:

Write a C program to sort a list of items using the bubble sort algorithm.

## Challenge 7:

Write a C program to sort a list of items using the quicksort algorithm.

## Challenge 8:

Write a C program to find the position of a target value in a sorted array using binary search.

## Challenge 9:

Write a C program to find the position of a target value in an array using linear search.

## Challenge 10:

Write a C program that displays the squares of the elements of an array of integers using the following two methods: the first is based on a Display Square function which takes the array as a parameter and displays the squares of all its elements, and the second uses a Square function which displays the square of an integer entered as a parameter.
