## Challenge 1: multiplication table

Write an algorithm that asks the user for a number, then displays its multiplication table from 1 to 10

## Challenge 2: star pyramid

Write the program to have a star pyramid, the number of lines to compose is asked to the user. (each line must have a prime number of stars

## Challenge 3:

Write a C program that reads an integer and then determines whether it is prime or not.

We recall that an integer is said to be prime if it has exactly two different divisors; 1 and himself.

Ex: 2, 3, 7, 17, 101 are all prime, and 4, 10, 27 are not.

## Challenge 4:

Write a C program that reads a series of positive integers less than 100 terminated by 0 . And which should disregard any input strictly greater than 100 . Then calculates and displays the sum and the max of the elements of this series.

## Challenge 5:

Write a C program that reads an integer and displays it inverted. We will choose not to display digit by digit but to build the inverted integer and then display it.

Eg: if the input is 12345 we must display the integer 54321 .

## Challenge 6:

In this exercise we will proceed as follows: we go through with a for loop of counter p , the integers between 2 and n , n being the number entered by the user ( line 9 ). And, each time we perform a primality test on p ( lines 11-15 ), if it turns out to be prime, we display it on the field.

## Challenge 7:

Write a C program that calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence, defined as follows: Un=Un-1+Un-2 where U1=U0=1 .

## Challenge 8:

Write a C program that uses the principle of dichotomy to find the solution of the equation x3+12x2+1=0 in the interval [-15,-10] with a precision of 0.00001 .

## Challenge 9:

Write a c program to find the power of a number using while loops . The base number (>0) and the exponent (>=0) are taken from the test cases.

## Challenge 10:

Write a program in C to calculate the sum of the maximum of 10 numbers ignoring negative numbers from the calculation.
