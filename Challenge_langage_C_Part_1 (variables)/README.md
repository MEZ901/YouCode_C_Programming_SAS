#Work to do

##Challenge 1: Display Information

Write a program in C that will allow you to display your personal information: Last name, first name, Age, Sex and telephone number. Data is entered from the keyboard.

##Challenge 2: Conversion from °C to °F

Write a program that asks for the temperature in Fahrenheit and transforms it into degrees Celsius

The formula: F = (C*1.8)+32

##Challenge 3: Convert Mile to Km

Write a program that asks for the distance in Meter and transforms it in Mile

The formula: Mile = Km*1.609

(take metric conversion into account)

##Challenge 4: Convert Mile to Km

Write a program that asks for the distance in Miles and transforms it into Meters

The formula: Km = Mile/1.609

(take metric conversion into account)

##Challenge 5: Temperature Display

Write a program that asks for the temperature in Fahrenheit and transforms it into degrees Celsius and displays the feeling felt (very cold, cold, hot, very hot)

The formula: C = (F-32)/1.8

##Challenge 6: Conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius

Write a program that asks for the temperature in Fahrenheit and transforms it into degrees Celsius

The formula: C = (F-32)/1.8

##Challenge 7: Calculate and display result in decimal format

a and b are two integers entered on the keyboard, calculate and display a+b, ab, a*b, a/b, a%b in decimal format, and taking care of the man/machine interface. (a/b gives the quotient of the division, a%b gives the remainder of the division)

##Challenge 8: Average and sum of 4 numbers

Write a C program to find the sum and average of four numbers. Take input from the end user.

Explanation :

Given three numbers a, b and c then, Sum = (a+b+c) and, Average = sum/3

##Challenge 9: Distance between two points

Write a C program to find the distance between two given points.

The distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. To find the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) , just use the coordinates of these ordered pairs and apply the formula. distance formula

Suppose we have two points M and N, whose coordinates are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) respectively . Their distance can be represented by MN and can be calculated according to the formula below,

The first point (M):- (x1, y1) Second point (N): (x2, y2) Distance (MN):- √((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²) Example:- M = (4, 8) N = (12, 14) Then the distance between M and N is MN = √((12-4)² + (14-8)²) = √(64 + 36) = √(100) = 10

##Challenge 10: Circumference of a circle

Write a program to find the circumference of a circle. Take the radius of the circle as user input.

The formula for, the circumference of the circle = 2πr ; where r is the radius.

##Challenge 11: Circumference of a rectangle

Write a program to find the circumference of a rectangle. Take the length and width of the rectangle as input from the user.

The formula for the circumference of a rectangle = 2*(length + width) .

##Challenge 12: Three-digit whole number in reverse order

Write a C program to display a three-digit integer in reverse order without using the loop. For example, if the whole number is 234, its inverse is 432.

##Challenge 13: Displaying the equivalent octal and hexadecimal value

Write a C program to display the equivalent value in octal and hexadecimal. Enter an integer and display its equivalent value in octal and hexadecimal.
